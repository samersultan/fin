# Contributing

Please feel free to offer any suggestions, or point out any issues with the project. I will make every attempt to pull updates that I think are valuable for my own workflow. For the most part I'm not interested in adding any other frameworks or anything to do with a command line like Node, Phantom, Jekyll, Grunt, Compass, Peter Pan or Shiny New OOP. Sorry.
